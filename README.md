# How to use  

We have two files in repo

1. [dynamic_wallsh.sh](https://github.com/Sanjay0302/dynamic_wall.sh/blob/master/dynamic_wallsh.sh)
2. [simple_final.sh](https://github.com/Sanjay0302/dynamic_wall.sh/blob/master/simple_final.sh)

Both are exactly same but [dynamic_wallsh.sh](https://github.com/Sanjay0302/dynamic_wall.sh/blob/master/dynamic_wallsh.sh) offers TUI bases interactive selection menu built using `whiptail`

Dowmload the `whiptail` or `simple` version and perform the below operations

# Make the  file executable
If a file is already executable, the permission for execute will be indicated by the letter 'x' in the appropriate position.

Here is how it looks:
**`-rwxr-xr-x`**
* To see that here is the example:
```bash
ls -l dynamic_wallsh.sh
```
